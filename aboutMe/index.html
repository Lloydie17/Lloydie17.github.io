		Hi, my name is John Lloyd A. Miral. I was born on November 17, 2002. I currently live in 
		Brgy. Ermita Proper, Cebu City. I have 2 siblings and we are 3 in total, 1 girl and 2 boys. My 
		parent's name are Dante T. Miral and Armina A. Miral.</p></pre>
		<pre><p align="justify" style="color:black; font-size:17; font-family:Hervetica; text-align:justify;">
		There are a lot of things about myself but I'll just put what I really love to do. I love to play 
		games because for me it helps me to forget my problems and escape from the reality. I'm not 
		playing games just for fun or etc. I played games not just for fun but to express what I felt. I 
		also love to watch movies because everytime I watch new movies and if there's a lesson from 
		the movie. I'll remember it and apply what I've learned from the movie.</p></pre>
		<pre><p align="justify" style="color:black; font-size:17; font-family:Hervetica; text-align:justify;">
		To be honest I'm an introvert, I don't usually socialize with a lot of people. I have a lot of bad
		and good friends but I don't socialize with my bad friends because they always do things that 
		I don't like. I only socialize with my good friends but good thing is they're only 2, I only trust 
		both of them. What I like about myself is that I'm Kind, Gentlemen, Friendly, Faithful, and my 
		Patient. I don't easily get mad but if I will, I can't control myself and that's the thing that I don't 
		like about myself.</p></pre>
		
		<pre><p align="justify" style="color:black; font-size:17; font-family:Hervetica; text-align:justify;">
		My goals in life are to become successful but before that I will study hard till I graduate, get my 
		dream job, give my parents a better life and buy our own house and lot. I also have inspirational
		quote by the famous agent from russia "If you're not a good shot today, don't worry. There are
		other ways to be useful" -<i>Sova</i>. I love this quote so much because sometimes I had a bad day.
		Since I've read this quote I feel motivated and confident if I have a bad day I'll just relax myself
		find something that will make my day better.</p></pre>
		
		<pre><p align="justify" style="color:black; font-size:17; font-family:Hervetica; text-align:justify;">
		I also do live streaming and editing videos and I will upload it in my Youtube channel or Facebook
		account. Check out my video below and links of my Facebook and Youtube Channel.</p></pre>
