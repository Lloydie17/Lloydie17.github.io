                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">Magellan's expedition set sail from Spain in August 1519 on a quest to discover a western route to the Moluccas, or Spice Islands. Magellan first saw the mountains of what is now Samar on March 16, 1521 (Julian calendar). The arrival of the first documented Europeans in the archipelago was commemorated by this event. Magellan ordered his men to anchor their ships on the shores of Homonhon Island the next day.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">Magellan made friends with Rajah Kolambu and Rajah Siagu, the Limasawa kings, who led him to Cebu. There he met the Rajah of Cebu, Rajah Humabon. Rajah Humabon and his queen were then baptized into the Catholic faith and given the Christian names Carlos and Juana, respectively, in honor of King Charles of Spain and King Charles' mother. Magellan gave Juana the Santo Nio, an image of the infant Jesus, as a symbol of their new alliance, and they held their first Mass on the coast to commemorate the event.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">Because of Magellan's influence with Rajah Humabon, each of the nearby chiefs was given an order to provide food for the ships and convert to Christianity. The majority of the chiefs complied. The only one who objected was Datu Lapulapu, one of the two chiefs on the island of Mactan, who refused to accept Rajah Humabon's authority in these matters. This opposition had a significant impact. Magellan's voyage chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, wrote that the island's other chief, Zula, sent one of his sons to Magellan with gifts, but Lapulapu stopped them and refused to swear fealty to Spain.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">Magellan was advised by Rajah Humabon and Datu Zula to travel to Mactan in order to force Datu's compliance. Magellan saw an opportunity to strengthen his friendship with the ruler of the Visayan region, so he agreed to assist him in subduing the stubborn Lapulapu.</p>
