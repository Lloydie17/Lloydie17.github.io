                                <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">About the Battle of Mactan</h2>
                                <hr>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">On April 27, 1521, the Battle of Mactan (Cebuano: Gubat sa Mactan; Filipino: Labanan sa Mactan) took place in the Philippines' archipelago. A Spanish force fighting for Rajah Humabon of Cebu was overpowered and defeated by the warriors of Lapulapu, one of the Datus of Mactan, who were led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who was killed in the battle. The Spanish crew was forced to leave the Philippine archipelago as a result of the battle's outcome.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">Before that, Ferdinand Magellan arrived in Mazaua and befriended the island's sovereign ruler, Rajah Kolambu, as well as his brother, Rajah Siagu of Butuan, and sealed their friendship with a blood compact—which was common in most of Southeast Asia and was customary among the indigenous people—and it was then that Magellan introduced Christianity and the Philippines' first mass.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">Because of Magellan's influence with Rajah Humabon, an order was issued to the nearby chiefs that each of them provide food supplies for Magellan's ship and convert to Christianity. Most of the chiefs obeyed the order, with the exception of Datu Lapulapu, who refused. Magellan should go to Mactan and force his subject chieftain, Datu Lapu-Lapu, to obey his orders, according to Rajah Humabon and Datu Zula. The night before the battle, Magellan tried to persuade Lapu-Lapu to follow Rajah Humabon's orders.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">Magellan set sail early in the morning with 49 armored men wielding swords, axes, shields, crossbows, and guns. Magellan miscalculated the attack due to coral reefs and rock outcroppings near the beach, and their ships were not allowed to get into effective range for their cannons.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">When the natives saw their houses on fire, Magellan sent some men to burn them down in order to scare them away, but the natives went on a rampage and shot them.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">One of Mactan's Datus, Lapulapu's warriors, defeated a Spanish force led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who was killed in the battle.</p>
