Thus, there once were two more generations of our forefathers who lived free from the yoke of Spain, thanks to this warrior. The hero is none other than the valiant Lapulapu. He was one of the chiefs of Mactan Island in the Visayas. He was responsible for defeating the head of the Spanish expedition to Southeast Asia, the Portuguese Ferdinand Magellan. Lapulapu and his men vanquished Magellan in the Battle of Mactan on April 1521.</p>

A Spanish force fighting for Rajah Humabon of Cebu was overpowered and defeated by the warriors of Lapulapu, one of the Datus of Mactan, who were led by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, who was killed in the battle. The Spanish crew was forced to leave the Philippine archipelago as a result of the battle's outcome. <a class="anchor" href="intro.html"> Read More</a></p>

Magellan first saw the mountains of what is now Samar on March 16, 1521 (Julian calendar). The arrival of the first documented Europeans in the archipelago was commemorated by this event. Magellan ordered his men to anchor their ships on the shores of Homonhon Island the next day. <a class="anchor" href="background.html"> Read More</a></p>

They encircled Magellan's landing party from all sides, attacking from the front and flanks. The Spaniards were largely protected from this barrage by their heavy armor, which resulted in only a few deaths among the Europeans, but it was extremely demoralizing for the troops. <a class="anchor" href="battle.html"> Read More</a></p>
