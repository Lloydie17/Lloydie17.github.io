                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">The natives attacked Magellan's small force with a barrage of ranged weapons, including arrows, iron-tipped "bamboo" throwing spears (probably rattan bangkaw), fire-hardened sticks, and even stones, as soon as they landed. They encircled Magellan's landing party from all sides, attacking from the front and flanks. The Spaniards were largely protected from this barrage by their heavy armor, which resulted in only a few deaths among the Europeans, but it was extremely demoralizing for the troops.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">By firing from the boats, the musketeers and crossbowmen on the boat attempted to provide support. Though the natives' light armor and shields were vulnerable to European projectile weapons, the barrage had little effect because the Europeans were firing from such a long distance and the natives were able to easily avoid them. Due to the same distance, Magellan was unable to command them to halt and save their ammunition, so the musketeers and crossbowmen continued firing for another half-hour until their ammunition was depleted.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">Magellan attempted to calm the natives by setting fire to some of the houses, but this only enraged them. The natives charged the Europeans for close-quarters combat after Magellan was hit with a poisoned arrow through his unarmored legs.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">Many of the warriors targeted Magellan in particular. He was stabbed in the arm by a spear and in the leg by a large native sword during the battle (likely a kampilan). Those who stood by him were easily overpowered and killed, while those who attempted to assist him were hacked to death with spears and swords. Lapulapu's troops finally overwhelmed and killed Magellan with this advantage. Pigafetta and a few other people were able to flee.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">Several of Magellan's men were killed in battle, according to Pigafetta, and a number of native converts to Catholicism who had come to their aid were also killed by the warriors.</p>
                                <p class="fs-5 mb-4" align="justify">Humabon and Zula, Magellan's allies, were said to have refused to fight in the battle at Magellan's request. They stood back and watched.</p>
